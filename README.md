    <li>Selenium 4 - Testing Library</li>
    <li>TestNG - Test Framework</li>

<p>
  In this assignment I have completed 2 Test Flows - <br>
  <ul type="number">
    <li>Search A Content</li>
    <li>Search Centers</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The test cases will be found under <b>src/test/java/testcases.search</b> package.
</p>
<p>
  In order to execute test case, you need to run right click on the <b>testng.xml</b> file present in the root,<br>
  and click on run as testNg.
</p>
 <p>
   The tests reports can be found under <b> extent-report</b> folder in the root directory.

   IF you want to change the browser then you need to change the browser property in the config file which is located at <br>
   <b>src/main/resources/config.properties</b>
 </p>
